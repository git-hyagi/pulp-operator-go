                            <key, value> as a "bucket", and try to put balanced number
                            of pods into each bucket. It's a required field.

                            a pod if it doesn''t satisfy the spread constraint. -
                            DoNotSchedule (default) tells the scheduler not to schedule
                            it. - ScheduleAnyway tells the scheduler to schedule the
                            pod in any location, but giving higher precedence to topologies
                            that would help reduce the skew. A constraint is considered
                            "Unsatisfiable" for an incoming pod if and only if every
                            possible node assignment for that pod would violate "MaxSkew"
                            on some topology. For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew
                            is set to 1, and pods with the same labelSelector spread
                            as 3/1/1: | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 | | P P P |   P   |   P   |
                            If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming
                            pod can only be scheduled to zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2)
                            as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3) satisfies MaxSkew(1).
                            In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but
                            scheduler won''t make it *more* imbalanced. It''s a required
                            field.'
